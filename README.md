# Phase 5: Complete Database System & Final Implementation (Government Relief Department) üöÄ

---

## ‚úÖ Project Finalization: Overview

This repository represents the **Final Submission (Phase 5)** of the **Government Relief Department Database** project. This phase integrates all previous development stages (Design, Basic DML/DDL, Relational Joins, Advanced Programming) into one fully functional and robust SQL system.

The database is built upon a detailed schema of **25 interconnected tables** and is designed to manage citizens, relief programs, fund allocations, and disaster events. This submission demonstrates mastery across the entire spectrum of SQL, from foundational structure to complex automation and integrity enforcement.

## üéØ Phase 5 & Project Goals Achieved

The comprehensive final script meets all high-level requirements:

1.  **Full Schema Implementation:** Successful creation and population of **25 tables** with a minimum of **20 records** each.
2.  **Data Integrity:** Implemented **Primary and Foreign Keys** across all tables, ensuring relational integrity.
3.  **Advanced Programming:** Implementation of **Stored Procedures, Functions, and Triggers** for automation and logic encapsulation.
4.  **Complex Analysis:** Execution of **50 situation-based queries** covering multi-table joins, subqueries, aggregation, and window functions.
5.  **Audit Trails & Security:** Implementation of **Triggers** to automatically log changes (auditing) and enforce critical business rules (e.g., preventing changes to national IDs).

## üß† Core SQL Components Demonstrated

The `phase5.sql` script is a holistic demonstration of expertise in database management:

### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
* **Schema Creation:** `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE` for all 25 entities.
* **Constraints:** Defined `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, and `UNIQUE` constraints.

### 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
* **Population:** Extensive use of `INSERT INTO` to populate all tables.
* **Modification:** Demonstrating transactional `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands.

### 3. Advanced Query Language (DQL)
* **Relational Analysis:** All types of **JOINs** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT).
* **Aggregation:** Use of `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.
* **Subqueries:** Utilizing nested `SELECT` statements for dynamic filtering.
* **Conditional Logic:** Employing `CASE` and `IF()` statements for business logic reporting.

### 4. Database Programming (Automation & Logic)
| Object Type | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stored Procedures** | Encapsulating complex multi-step reporting or data retrieval. |
| **Functions** | Calculating key metrics (e.g., percentage usage) for reuse in queries. |
| **Triggers** | Automating audit trails, logging data changes, and enforcing data integrity rules (e.g., preventing illegal updates). |
| **Transaction Control** | Using `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` for safe data modification. |

## üìÇ Repository Contents

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`phase5.sql`** | The *complete* and final SQL script. Contains all DDL, DML, Triggers, Procedures, Functions, and the 50 comprehensive analytical queries. |
| `README.md` (This file) | Final project documentation and summary. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Execution

This script is designed to be executed in a single run to create the entire database system.

1.  **Prerequisites:** A MySQL, MariaDB, or compatible SQL server environment.
2.  **Execution:** Connect to your SQL server and execute the entire contents of the **`phase5.sql`** file.
3.  **Result:** The script will first create the database and tables, then populate the data, and finally demonstrate the functionality of all advanced objects and analytical queries.
